# TodoMVC · AI coding workshop

A small, plain JavaScript app for practicing how to investigate code, write a short spec or plan, implement a change with an agent, and review a pull request.

The starter can add, edit, complete, filter, and delete todos. **Data is saved in the browser's `localStorage` and survives reloads.** There is no application backend in this starter.

## Setup

You need Node.js **26.10.0** (or a newer 26.x release), Git, and a coding assistant you are signed into. Use a GitHub account for your fork and PR.

Fork [snip-ki/todomvc-workshop](https://github.com/snip-ki/todomvc-workshop), clone **your fork**, and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5173**. No Docker, environment file, API key, global Vite+ CLI, or database setup is needed.

Before the workshop, add a todo, confirm it is still there after a reload, and run `npm run verify`. Check that your agent can read the repo and run commands. If it has browser tools, check that it can open the app too. Wait for the facilitator to hand out the session task.

## Commands

| Command          | Purpose                                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`    | Start Vite+ on port 5173.                        |
| `npm test`       | Run the baseline tests.                          |
| `npm run verify` | Check formatting and lint, run tests, and build. |
| `npm run format` | Format files.                                    |

Use npm and keep `package-lock.json`. If port 5173 is busy, run `npm run dev -- --port 5174`. The upstream CSS may print a non-blocking placeholder-selector warning during builds.

## Code map

- `src/app.js`: connects the app.
- `src/controller.js`: user actions and rendering.
- `src/model.js`: todo operations and counts.
- `src/store.js`: `localStorage` storage with an in-memory fallback.
- `src/view.js`, `src/template.js`, `src/helpers.js`: DOM, markup, and events.
- `tests/todos.test.js`: baseline behavior checks.

## Agent skills

Project skills live in [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/). Use them when the facilitator or your prompt names them (for example decision logging, continuity ledger, planning, or changelog). Session tasks come from the facilitator, not from this repository.

Codex, Pi, and Cursor load `.agents/skills/` directly. Claude Code reads the same folders through per-skill symlinks under [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/). Optional project history lives in [changelog.md](changelog.md) when you use the `agent-changelog` skill.

## Submit your change

1. Create a branch in your fork: `git switch -c workshop/your-name`.
2. Implement the task, inspect the diff, and run `npm run verify`.
3. Commit your changes and push the branch to **your fork**.
4. Open a PR against **[snip-ki/todomvc-workshop](https://github.com/snip-ki/todomvc-workshop)** on branch `main` (base: `main`, head: your fork’s branch).
5. Describe the behavior, tests, and browser checks. Review another pair's PR.

During the workshop, `main` on [snip-ki/todomvc-workshop](https://github.com/snip-ki/todomvc-workshop) stays the shared starting point.
